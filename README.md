# Tic Tac Toe
This is a Java based GUI standalone game, which you can play with your friend anytime.
Its features include that apart from being a nice graphical interface you can at anytime either reset the game
or even swap your symbol with your opponent/friend, if you get bored of your symbol :p

Just run the **TicTacToe.jar** file in the *executable* folder, and your are good to go.

Have FUN!!! :)
